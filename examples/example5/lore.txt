## Quest Description

### Title: *Whispers of the Hollow Moon*

### World Context:
In the twilight realm of **Elarion**, the two moons‚Äî**Vel'Harra** and **Noctis**‚Äîhave long governed the tides of magic. When Noctis, the Hollow Moon, vanishes from the sky during an eclipse, the balance falters. Nightmares slip into reality, dream-beasts roam the lands, and the ancient race of **Somniari**, guardians of sleep and memory, begin to disappear.

Legends speak of an ancient ritual‚Äîthe *Lunar Sealing*‚Äîcapable of restoring Noctis to the sky. But the rite requires the lost **Lunar Sigils**, scattered across Elarion in long-forgotten dream-temples. Only a Dreambound, one who can walk both reality and dream, may reclaim them.

### Initial State:
You awaken in the **Waking Marshes**, burdened by fragmented dreams and a strange mark on your palm. A Somniari elder, now half-mad, reveals your nature as Dreambound and urges you to seek the *Astral Chime*, the first Lunar Sigil.

### Goal:
Recover all four **Lunar Sigils** and perform the **Lunar Sealing** at the ancient observatory of **Skyvault Cradle** before the next total eclipse, when Elarion will be forever consumed by waking nightmares.

### Obstacles:
- Navigating the **Dreamtide**, a shifting zone between dream and reality
- Facing **Mirrorkin**, twisted reflections of your past choices
- Decoding memory-puzzles left by the vanished Somniari
- Resisting **Sleep Decay**, which erodes your identity
- Encountering dream-versions of allies and enemies with distorted intentions
