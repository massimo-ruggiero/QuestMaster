# Lore Document: The Lost Artifact

## Quest Description
In the desert kingdom of Zahara, rumors speak of an ancient artifact buried beneath the sands—a jeweled scarab said to grant its bearer control over the winds. A daring explorer must uncover the scarab before a rival treasure hunter does, and escape the desert with the artifact intact.

## Initial State
– Explorer “Arya” is at OasisVillage.  
– Arya carries MapFragmentA.  
– Sandstorm is inactive.  
– GuardianStatue at Ruins is dormant.  
– RivalHunter “Kharun” is at CaravanCamp, unarmed.

## Goal
– Arya possesses JeweledScarab.  
– Arya is at OasisVillage.

## Obstacles
