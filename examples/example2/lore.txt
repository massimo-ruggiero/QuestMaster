# Lore Document: The Relic of the Sunken Temple

## 1. Quest Description
**Title:** The Relic of the Sunken Temple  
**Setting:**  
Beneath the waves off the coast of Thalara lies an ancient submerged temple, home to a powerful relic said to control the tides. When seismic tremors threaten coastal villages with devastating floods, a daring adventurer must dive into the deep, navigate underwater ruins, and reclaim the relic before catastrophe strikes.

### Initial State
- The protagonist boards a small dive vessel at Thalara Harbor.  
- The sea is stormy, visibility underwater is poor.  
- A local scholar warns of aggressive sea creatures guarding the temple’s entrance.

### Goal
- Retrieve the Tideheart Relic from the Sunken Temple’s inner sanctum and surface safely.

### Possible Obstacles
1. **Underwater Currents in the Coral Chasm**  
   – Strong cross-currents may push the diver off course; require stabilizing gear or skillful swimming.  
2. **Collapsed Passage in the Eastern Hall**  
   – Blocks direct route; must clear debris (strength), find alternate tunnel (exploration), or use explosives (risking damage).  
3. **Guardian Eels in the Sanctum**  
   – Need to distract them (lure), sneak past in crevices (stealth), or confront them (combat).
