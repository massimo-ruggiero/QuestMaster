# Lore Document: The Crystal of Ithar

## Quest Description

In the forgotten land of **Ithar**, ancient forces have begun to stir. The **Crystal of Ithar**, a magical relic maintaining the balance between light and shadow, has been stolen by the rogue sorcerer **Malrek**. Without it, darkness spreads across the realm.

The player assumes the role of **Elara**, a young ranger gifted with the Sight, who must retrieve the Crystal before the next eclipse, or the land will fall into eternal night.

### Initial State
- Elara is in the village of **Thandor**.
- The **Crystal** is located in **Malrek's Tower**.
- The path to the tower is blocked by a **collapsed bridge** and a **dark forest** haunted by cursed spirits.
- Elara has a **bow** but lacks the **light amulet** required to pass safely through the forest.

### Goal
- Retrieve the **Crystal of Ithar** and return it to **Thandor** before the eclipse.

### Obstacles
- Bridge must be rebuilt using wood from the forest.
- Spirits must be banished with the **light amulet**, found in the **Abandoned Temple**.
- Malrek must be defeated in his tower using a strategy that weakens his power.

### World Context
Ithar is a land of magic, ruins, and ancient temples. Powerful artifacts are hidden across the land, often protected by magical wards or guardians. Elaraâ€™s journey will require exploring, forging alliances, solving puzzles, and surviving dark forces.
