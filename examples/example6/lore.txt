## Quest Description

### Title: *Shadows of the Iron Citadel*

### World Context  
In the war-torn realm of **Kharzon**, the Iron Citadel stands astride the Ashen Vale as both fortress and prison. Forged by long-dead technomancers, its walls pulse with arcane runes that suppress all magic within. Now, a fatal instability in the Citadel’s core threatens to unleash a cataclysmic pulse, one that could rend the very fabric of Kharzon’s reality.

Ancient texts speak of the **Echo of Creation**, a primordial shard hidden in the Citadel’s deepest vault. Only by realigning the core with this Echo can the Citadel be saved—and the realm spared.

### Initial State  
Under cover of a howling thunderstorm, you and your allies approach the Citadel’s outer bailey. The gates lie sealed by rune-locked wards, and sentinels of wraithsteel patrol the battlements. Your mission: infiltrate the fortress, find the Echo, and recalibrate the core before dawn.

### Goal  
Retrieve the **Echo of Creation** and recalibrate the Citadel’s core, preventing the incoming Resonance Rift from annihilating Kharzon.

### Obstacles  
- **Rune-Locked Gates**: Ancient seals requiring cryptic sigil-decoding or brute force  
- **Wraithsteel Sentinels**: Haunted constructs of metal and spirit sworn to protect the Citadel  
- **Labyrinth of Echoes**: A shifting network of mirrored corridors that warp perception and time  
- **Resonance Warp**: The core’s unstable field bleeds into reality, causing hallucinations and temporal loops  
- **The Iron Warden**: A fallen hero bound as the fortress’s immortal guardian
