# Lore Document: The Echoing Crystal of Nyx

## Quest Description

In the shadowed realm of **Umbra**, the legendary **Echoing Crystal of Nyx**—keeper of sound and silence—fractured during the last **Lunar Eclipse**, scattering its shards across four mysterious domains: the **Cavern of Whispers** (sound), the **Mirror Lake** (reflection), the **Shadow Vale** (darkness), and the **Spire of Silence** (void). If the crystal is not reforged before the next **Eclipse of Nyx**, all sound will unravel into void, plunging Umbra into eternal stillness. The player embodies **Talia**, a novice **Echo Weaver** gifted with the **Tone Sigil**, who must recover each shard and reignite the crystal’s resonant harmony in the **Hall of Resonance**.

## Initial State
- Talia is in the **Hall of Resonance**, holding the **Tone Sigil** but lacking the **Reflection**, **Darkness**, and **Void Sigils**.  
- Four shards of the Echoing Crystal lie hidden in:
  - **Cavern of Whispers**  
  - **Mirror Lake**  
  - **Shadow Vale**  
  - **Spire of Silence**  
- Each domain is sealed by its own guardian.

## Goal
Reforge the **Echoing Crystal of Nyx** in the **Hall of Resonance** before the **Eclipse of Nyx** completes its dark cycle.

## Obstacles
- **Echo Wraiths** guard the Cavern of Whispers.  
- **Sirens** haunt the shores of Mirror Lake.  
- **Umbral Beasts** prowl the depths of the Shadow Vale.  
- **Silence Wardens** stand sentinel atop the Spire of Silence.  
- The **Ritual of Resonance** must be performed under the shadow of the eclipse.

## World Context
Umbra is a realm where sound shapes reality and silence conceals truth. Four elemental echoes—sound, reflection, darkness, and void—govern its domains, each steeped in ancient magic and hidden betrayals that intertwine fate and legend.
