# Lore Document: The Shattered Kingdom

## Quest Description
**Title:** The Shattered Kingdom  
**Setting:**  
In the realm of Eldoria, a once-unified kingdom has been torn apart by a dark sorcerer who shattered the Crystal of Unity, the source of peace and harmony.

- Elara must collect the remaining Crystal Fragments from the factions and restore the Crystal of Unity.  
- Elara needs to confront Malakar and defeat him to bring peace back to Eldoria.
