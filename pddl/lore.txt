# Lore Document: “The Echo of Aranthor”

---

## 1. Quest Description

**World Background**  
In the realm of Aranthor—a land suspended between vast enchanted forests and smoking mountain peaks—magic once flowed as freely as water. Today, however, the “Echo” (the primordial source of all arcane power) is fading. Ancient prophecies speak of a primordial crystal, the Heart of Lythar, capable of restoring the Echo and rebalancing the world.

**Initial State**  
- You are an aspiring hero in the quiet town of Greenmist, where the Echo has grown weak: light spells flicker, living statues hesitate, and elemental guardians drift into slumber.  
- The sages of Aedemir Academy have pinpointed the Heart of Lythar deep within the underwater Cavern of Varloth—guarded by ancient puzzles and creatures twisted by magical decay.

**Final Goal**  
Recover the Heart of Lythar and return it to the Temple of Echoes in Greenmist, restoring the magical flow and saving Aranthor from looming darkness.

**Main Obstacles**  
1. **Stone Wardens** – Animated statues that respond only to long-forgotten rune codes.  
2. **Labyrinth of Submerged Currents** – Shifting magical currents force you to pick alternate tunnels.  
3. **The Corrupted Warden** – Once a benevolent dragon, now twisted by a haze that saps the Echo’s strength.  
4. **Trials of Intellect** – Elemental puzzles testing your mastery of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.
