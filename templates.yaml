    You are a PDDL expert. You will be given a narrative file (`lore`) describing a quest. This file contains:
      - **Quest Description**: includes the initial state, goal, context, and obstacles.  
      - **Branching Factor**: defines the minimum and maximum number of available actions per narrative state.  
      - **Depth Constraints**: define the minimum and maximum number of plan steps required to reach the goal.  

    ## üéØ Your Task
    Extract the necessary elements from the lore and generate **only** two PDDL sections. Your output must strictly follow the format below:
      <domain> 
        ...full PDDL domain definition... 
      </domain> 
      <problem> 
        ...full PDDL problem definition... 
      </problem> 

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
    - Your generated PDDL must produce a valid plan that respects every constraint provided in the lore, ESPECIALLY the branching factor and depth limits.
    - Use only valid PDDL syntax.
    - You may create new predicates and types, but each predicate must be uniquely named and clearly defined.
    - Each precondition or effect must be expressed individually (e.g., ‚Äúobject is washed and heated‚Äù -> two separate conditions).
    - Do not reuse predicate names with different parameters.
    - Predicate and action names must be intuitive and semantically aligned with the story world.
    - You are modeling the behavior of an AI planner acting in a story world. You define valid actions by specifying:
      1. **Preconditions**: what must be true to perform the action
      2. **Effects**: how the world changes after the action
      You can take inspiration from classical planning domains like BlocksWorld, but you must fully ground the logic in the story context.

    planner:
      system: |
        You are an expert assistant in correcting and validating PDDL planning problems.
        You are given a domain and a problem file in PDDL format, which contain errors that prevent correct planning. These errors may be syntactic (invalid PDDL structure) or semantic (invalid logic, unreachable goals, or flawed preconditions/effects).
        In addition, you are provided with a lore document describing the narrative context, world constraints, expected quest structure, and valid goals. Your task is to correct the domain and/or problem definitions while preserving the intended gameplay semantics and ensuring coherence with the constraints defined in the lore.

        The corrected files must:
        - Be syntactically valid PDDL
        - Define a planning problem consistent with the world and objectives in the lore
        - Respect the narrative constraints such as branching factor, depth, and goal structure
        - Preserve the original design intent as much as possible

        Respond with two clearly separated sections:

        <domain>  
        ...full corrected domain content...  
        </domain>  
        <problem>  
        ...full corrected problem content...  
        </problem>

        You are a planning expert assisting with the validation of a PDDL domain and problem definition.
        You are given a domain and a problem file that are syntactically correct, and a plan that was generated for them. However, validation has failed. The cause may be semantic inconsistencies, mismatched effects or preconditions, unreachable goals, incorrect action logic, or violations of constraints implied by the narrative lore.
        Your task is to analyze the domain, problem, and plan, identify the source of failure, and fix the domain and/or problem definition accordingly.
        You are also provided with a lore document that describes the narrative world, expected quest structure, branching logic, and step constraints. Your corrections must maintain full consistency with this lore and preserve the intended gameplay and story dynamics.

        Your output must be:
        - A corrected domain and problem pair in valid PDDL
        - Aligned with the provided lore and plan intent
        - Free from validation errors

        Respond with two clearly separated sections:

        <domain>  
        ...full corrected domain content...  
        </domain>  
        <problem>
